## Generate sequences

Once we have a trained model, we can use it to generate new sequences. This can be done using the command:

```bash
  $ adabmDCA sample -p <path_params> -d <fasta_file> -o <output_folder> --ngen <num_gen>
```

where `output_folder` is the directory where to save the data and `num_gen` is the number of sequences to be generated. The routine will first compute the mixing time ($t^{\mathrm{mix}}$) of the model by running a simulation starting from the sequences of the input MSA. After that, it will randomly initialize `num_gen` Markov chains and run for `nmix` $\cdot t^{\mathrm{mix}}$ sweeps to ensure that the model equilibrates. It will save in the output directory a FASTA file containing the sequences sampled with the model and a text file containing the records used to determine the convergence of the algorithm. Figure [mixing time](#fig:mixing_time)-Right shows the comparison between the entries of the covariance matrices obtained from the data and from the generated sequences. The Pearson correlation coefficient is the same used as a target for the training and the slope is close to 1, meaning that the model is able to correctly recover the two-sites statistics of the data MSA.

### Convergence criterium
To determine the convergence of the Monte Carlo simulation, the following strategy is used. We extract \texttt{nmeasure}$=N$ sequences from the data MSA according to their statistical weight and we make a copy of them. The first set represents the chains simulated up to time $t$, and we denote them as $\pmb{A}(t) = \{\pmb{a}_1(t), \dots, \pmb{a}_{N}(t)\}$, while the sequences of the second set are the chains simulated until time $t/2$, and we call them $\pmb{A}(t/2) = \{\pmb{a}_1(t/2), \dots, \pmb{a}_{N}(t/2)\}$.
With some abuse of notation, we define the *intrachain correlation* and *autocorrelation* as

$$
    \mathrm{SeqID}(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathrm{SeqID}(\pmb{a}_i(t), \pmb{a}_{\sigma(i)}(t)) \qquad \mathrm{SeqID}(t, t/2) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathrm{SeqID}(\pmb{a}_i(t), \pmb{a}_i(t/2))
$$

where $\sigma(i)$ is a random permutation of the index $i$ and

$$
    \mathrm{SeqID}(\pmb{a}, \pmb{b}) = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{i=1}^L \delta_{a_i, b_i} \in [0, 1]
$$

is the normalized sequence identity (or overlap) between the sequences $\pmb{a}$ and $\pmb{b}$. By construction, at the initialization we have $\mathrm{SeqID}(t, t/2) = 1$ and $\mathrm{SeqID}(t)$ somewhat close to the average sequence identity of the MSA.  The convergence is obtained when chains are *mixed*, meaning that the system has completely forgotten the initial configuration. This requirement is satisfied when the statistics of a set of independent chains is the same as the one between the initialization and the evolved chains, meaning $\mathrm{SeqID}(t) \cong \mathrm{SeqID}(t, t/2)$. The point at which the two curves merge is called *mixing time*, and we denote it as $t^{\mathrm{mix}}$. After reaching the mixing time of the model, the algorithm will initialize `ngen` chains at random. It will run a sampling for other `nmix` $\cdot t^{\mathrm{mix}}$ steps to guarantee complete thermalization, with `nmix=2` by default. Together with the generated sequences, the script will output a text file containing the records of $\mathrm{SeqID}(t)$ and $\mathrm{SeqID}(t, t/2)$ and their standard deviations  (figure [mixing time](#fig:mixing_time)-Left).

Analysis of a bmDCA model. **Left**: measuring the mixing time of the model using $10^4$ chains. The curves represent the average overlap among randomly initialized samples (dark blue) and the one among the same sequences between times $t$ and $t/2$ (light blue). Shaded areas represent the error of the mean. When the two curves merge, we can assume that the chains at time $t$ forgot the memory of the chains at time $t/2$. This point gives us an estimate of the model's mixing time, $t^{\mathrm{mix}}$.  Notice that the times start from 1, so the starting conditions are not shown. **Right**: Scatter plot of the entries of the Covariance matrix of the data versus that of the generated samples.

## Contact prediction

One of the principal applications of the DCA models has been that of predicting a tertiary structure of a protein or RNA domain. In particular, with each pair of sites $i$ and $j$ in the MSA, `adabmDCA 2.0` computes a contact score that quantifies how likely the two associated positions in the chains are in contact in the three-dimensional structure.
Formally, it corresponds to the average-product corrected (APC) Frobenius norms of the coupling matrices {cite:p}`ekeberg_improved_2013`, i.e.

$$
F_{i,j}^{\rm APC} = F_{i,j} - \frac{\sum_{k} F_{i,k} \sum_{k} F_{k,j}}{\sum_{kl} F_{k,l}}, \quad F_{i,j} = \sqrt{\sum_{a,b \neq `-`} J_{i,j}\left(a, b \right)^{2}}
$$(eqn:frob)

Note that the coupling parameters are usually transformed in a zero-sum gauge before computing the scores, and the gap symbol should be neglected while computing the sum in Eq. [](#eqn:frob) {cite:p}`feinauer_improving_2014`. 
The scores for all site pairs are provided in the output folder in a separate file called `<label>_frobenius.txt` The first two columns indicate the site indices and the third one contains the associated APC Frobenius norm. The command for computing the matrix of Frobenius norms is

```bash
$ adabmDCA contacts -p <file_params>  -o <output_folder>
```

## Scoring a sequence set
At convergence, users can score a set of input sequences according to a trained DCA model by using the command line

```bash
  $ adabmDCA energies -d <fasta_file>  -p <file_params>  -o <output_folder>
```

`adabmDCA 2.0` will produce a new FASTA file in the output folder `<output_folder>` where the input sequences in `<fasta_file>` have an additional field in the name that account for the DCA energy function computed according to the model in `<file_params>`. Note that *low* energies correspond to good sequences.

## Single mutant library
Another possible application exploits the sequence-fitness score computable according to the energy function $E$ in Eq. [](#eqn:probDCA). This routine provides a single-mutant library for a given wild type to possibly guide Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments. In particular, `adabmDCA 2.0` allows one to predict the fitness reduction (increase) in terms of $\Delta E = E\left(\rm mutant \right) - E\left(\rm wildtype \right)$ for positive (negative) value of $\Delta E$, respectively {cite:p}`hopf_mutation_2017`.
To produce a FASTA file containing all weighted single-mutants one has to run

```bash
  $ adabmDCA DMS -d <WT> -p <file_params> -o <output_folder>
```

where `<WT>` is the name of the FASTA file containing the wild type sequence, `<file_params>` is a model file in a format compatible with `adabmDCA 2.0` output, and `<output_folder>` corresponds to the folder that will contain the library file. The sequences in the output FASTA file are named after the introduced mutation and the corresponding $\Delta E$; for instance, `>G27A | DCAscore: -0.6` denotes that position `27` has been changed from `G` to `A` and $\Delta E = -0.6$.
