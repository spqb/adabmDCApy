# adabmDCA 2.0 - Direct Coupling Analysis in Python

## ⚡ Overview

**adabmDCA 2.0** is a flexible yet easy-to-use implementation of Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) based on Boltzmann machine learning. This package provides tools for analyzing residue-residue contacts, predicting mutational effects, scoring sequence libraries, and generating artificial sequences, applicable to both protein and RNA families. The package is designed for flexibility and performance, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Julia, Python) and architectures (single-core/multi-core CPUs and GPUs).  
This repository contains the Python GPU version of adabmDCA, maintained by **Lorenzo Rosset**.

## ⬇️ Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI
Open a terminal and run
```bash
python -m pip install adabmDCA
```

### Option 2: Install from the GitHub repository
Clone the repository locally and then install the requirements and the package. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:spqb/adabmDCApy.git
cd adabmDCApy
pip install .
```

## 🕶️ Usage

After installation, all the main routines can be launched through the command-line interface using the command `adabmDCA`.

To get started with adabmDCA in Python, please refer to the [Documentation](https://spqb.github.io/adabmDCApy/) or the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l5e1W8pk4cB92JAlBElLzpkEk6Hdjk7B?usp=sharing).

### High-level Python API

The command-line workflows are also available as an intuitive Python API for
notebooks and applications:

```python
from adabmDCA import load_model

model = load_model("params.dat", alphabet="protein", device="auto")

energies = model.compute_energies(["ACDEFG...", "ACDEYG..."])
contacts = model.compute_contact_map()
mutations = model.scan_mutations("ACDEFG...").to_dataframe()
samples = model.sample(100, n_sweeps=1_000, seed=42)
```

Low-level tensor functions such as `compute_energy` remain available and
backward-compatible. See the [high-level API guide](docs/high_level_api.md) for
structured results, FASTA inputs, training, progress callbacks, and error
handling.
